Loops, Conditions and parsing 


Loops in Python are used to repeatedly execute a block of code. There are two main types
of loops:

1.For Loop - Iterates over a sequence (e.g., list, tuple, string) or other iterable objects.

2. While Loop - Continues to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

Conditions
Conditions in Python are used to control the flow of a program based on certain criteria. The main conditional statements are:

1. If Statement - Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.

2. If-Else Statement - Executes one block of code if a condition is true and another block if it's false.

Parsing
Parsing involves extracting meaningful information from data. In Python, parsing can be applied to strings and various data formats. Common parsing techniques include:

1. String Parsing - Involves breaking a string into smaller components, often using methods like split().

2. Parsing Numbers from strings - Involves converting numeric strings to actual numbers using functions like int() or float().

3. Using Regular Expressions(Regex) - Provides a powerful way to match and extract patterns from strings.
